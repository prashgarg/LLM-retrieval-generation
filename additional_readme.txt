Make sure you have created a key: (I) Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and then (ii) register/log-in, then (iii) create a new secret key and then (iv) put it in key/openai_key.txt

Start with "00_" to familiarise with OpenAI's API library and to authenticate. 

Then you can go through "10_" to "90_" in any order, or follow the suggested one. 

Refer to the slides for more context.

Everything is in Notebook format (.ipynb). I recommend VS Code, but other environments work too. You can also use collab to run it in your browser.
